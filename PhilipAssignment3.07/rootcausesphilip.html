  <center> Root Causes and Historial Context of the Issue </center>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col"> Root Cause 1: Electric consumers have financial and safety concerns about nuclear fusion power plants </div>
    <div class="col"> Evidence 1: “Rank and file consumers in general do not seem to care much about electric power production technologies [with the exception of electricity] rate increases of 2, 3, 4, or 5% [which] often generate public outcries.” <a href="https://ej-energy.org/index.php/ejenergy/article/view/18/17"> Public Acceptance of ITER-Tokamak Fusion Power</a></div>
    <div class="col"> Explanation 1: People usually do not care where their electricity comes from except when their electricity bill rates go up. If electricity bill rates increase with the construction of future fusion power plants, there could be decreased support for the proliferation of fusion reactors throughout the world.</div>
    <div class="col"> Evidence 2: “Greenpeace has strongly condemned investment in the International ITER Fusion Project, claiming, “The money spent on ITER should instead be spent on renewables. The Sierra Club noted that “the dangers posed by the probable releases of tritium used by fusion plants, the problems with
      decommissioning these plants, and their high costs lead the Sierra Club to believe that the development of fusion reactors to generate electricity should not be pursued at this time.” The Green Party also specifically opposes nuclear fusion. The paucity of comment on fusion is related to the fact that fusion is not now a commercial option.” <a href="https://ej-energy.org/index.php/ejenergy/article/view/18/17"> Public Acceptance of ITER-Tokamak Fusion Power</a></div>
    <div class="col"> Explanation 2: Environmental activist groups are likely to oppose nuclear fusion reactor developments, such as the ITER fusion reactor, because of the long development time and release of radioactive hydrogen isotopes. Without addressing these issues, people would distrust the reliability of fusion in fighting climate change.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col"> Root Cause 2: people relate fears of nuclear weapons to nuclear reactors for power generation
      </div>
      <div class="col"> Evidence 1: “Enrichment and reprocessing thus enabled the Cold War nuclear arms race and risk of cities being destroyed in minutes by nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles. Numerous studies have addressed the psychological effects of the arms race on [the public]. Elder generations of Americans, after all, grew up with “duck-and-cover” drills preparing for the use of nuclear weapons. Substantiating these anxieties, scholars have chronicled and publicized close calls and near-accidents involving nuclear weapons from the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis to the modern era [75–77].”

      </div>
      <div class="col"> Explanation 1: Fear of nuclear annihilation from the Cold War has caused many older Americans to associate this fear with nuclear power to produce electricity. Thus, they will be aversive to peaceful applications of nuclear energy, such as nuclear fusion as an energy source.
      </div>
      <div class="col"> Evidence 2: “Notably, the specific terms most commonly used among all respondents were strongly evocative of nuclear weapons and nuclear war: ‘bomb,’ ‘explosion,’ ‘cloud’—often paired with ‘mushroom,’ as in the two-word term, ‘mushroom cloud.’ Less common were terms referencing peaceful uses of nuclear technology: ‘power,’ ‘plant,’ their co-occurrence ‘power plant,’ and ‘energy’... 
        Overall, our analyses reveal the strong confluence of associations with nuclear power and nuclear weapons.”

      </div>
      <div class="col"> Explanation 2: A study in which researchers asked participants to “Describe the first image that comes to mind when [they] see the word ‘nuclear’” found that the majority of participants associated the word “nuclear” with destruction from nuclear weapons. As a result, this may also indicate that many of them would be unfamiliar with the application of nuclear fusion for energy production.

      <center> Implications for creating effective solutions </center>
      <div class="row">
      <div class="col">1. Although many of these concerns are engineering and scientific problems, the issue can improve through education about fusion and supporting STEM programs (science, technology, engineering, and math), which can inspire students to pursue a career in nuclear fusion to design better safety mechanisms, new machines or useful scientific software. </div>
      <div class="col"> 2. Creating fun, visual ways to educate people about fusion can make it easier to differentiate it between nuclear fission, which releases more dangerous radioactive isotopes. In addition, education about climate change can further emphasize the importance of the development of fusion reactors.</div>
