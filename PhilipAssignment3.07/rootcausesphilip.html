  <center> Root Causes and Historial Context of the Issue </center>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col"> Root Cause 1: Electric consumers have financial and safety concerns about nuclear fusion power plants </div>
    <div class="col"> Evidence 1: “Rank and file consumers in general do not seem to care much about electric power production technologies [with the exception of electricity] rate increases of 2, 3, 4, or 5% [which] often generate public outcries.” </div>
    <div class="col"> Explanation 1: People usually do not care where their electricity comes from except when their electricity bill rates go up. If electricity bill rates increase with the construction of future fusion power plants, there could be decreased support for the proliferation of fusion reactors throughout the world.</div>
    <div class="col"> Evidence 2: “Greenpeace has strongly condemned investment in the International ITER Fusion Project, claiming, “The money spent on ITER should instead be spent on renewables. The Sierra Club noted that “the dangers posed by the probable releases of tritium used by fusion plants, the problems with
      decommissioning these plants, and their high costs lead the Sierra Club to believe that the development of fusion reactors to generate electricity should not be pursued at this time.” The Green Party also specifically opposes nuclear fusion. The paucity of comment on fusion is related to the fact that fusion is not now a commercial option.”</div>
    <div class="col"> Explanation 2: Environmental activist groups are likely to oppose nuclear fusion reactor developments, such as the ITER fusion reactor, because of the long development time and release of radioactive hydrogen isotopes. Without addressing these issues, people would distrust the reliability of fusion in fighting climate change.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col"> Root Cause 2: investments and external events influence opinions about nuclear fusion </div>
      <div class="col"> Evidence 1: “Those who [were] old enough to not see the majority of effects could even be part of or financially tied to the fossil fuel industry. Voting for another industry would be against their own best interests, as doing so would harm their own fiscal earnings. Furthermore, the older populations have experienced numerous nuclear disasters, which made headlines, while the younger respondents have not, perhaps swaying the older respondent’s opinion against the idea.”
      </div>
      <div class="col"> Explanation 1: Older Americans often have investments in the fossil fuel industry and are more familiar with nuclear power plant disasters. They could be more aversive to fusion power plants if it harms their investments.
      </div>
      <div class="col"> Evidence 2: “Those within the age range of 18 to 34 fall in favor of nuclear energy. The generations which would expect to see the results of climate change in their lifetime are more willing to move from traditional fossil fuels, while those who will not see the impacts are more likely to be against nuclear energy.”
      </div>
      <div class="col"> Explanation 2: More younger Americans are supporting nuclear energy because they will be the ones to suffer the impacts of climate change. If they are more open to clean energy technologies, they are more likely to support the development of nuclear fusion power plants.</div>

      <center> Implications for creating effective solutions </center>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col">1. Although many of these concerns are engineering and scientific problems, the issue can improve through education about fusion and supporting STEM programs (science, technology, engineering, and math), which can inspire students to pursue a career in nuclear fusion to design better safety mechanisms, new machines or useful scientific software. </div>
      <div class="col"> 2. Creating fun, visual ways to educate people about fusion can make it easier to differentiate it between nuclear fission, which releases more dangerous radioactive isotopes. In addition, education about climate change can further emphasize the importance of the development of fusion reactors.</div>
